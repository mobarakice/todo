# Sample TODO Android App Architecture

The Sample TODO app has been developed for demonstrating the MVVM (Model View ViewModel ) design pattern and Android Architecture component (Navigation component, LifeCycle, ViewModel, LiveData, Databinding), Retrofit 2 for network operation, and RxJava for handling asynchronous and background tasks. In this document will describe project architecture and all API's by the following below sections:
- App architecture blueprint
- Project structure with app process flow (based on the packaging)
- API short print with references

## App architecture blueprint
We are using MVVM design patterns and to flow best practices. The chart below will show architecture details.

## Project structure with app process flow (based on the packaging)
The app has following packages:
- **data:** It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
- **ui:** View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
- **utility:** Utility classes.

Screen navigation flow:
